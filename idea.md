This project will build an AI loan assistant using IBM Watsonx.ai to provide applicants with instant, accurate answers, reducing their time and frustration in researching loan information. 
The project will focus on: 
    1. Implementing RAG with documents to minimize LLM hallucinations. 
    2. Using Tool Calling (e.g., calculator, unit convertor) to ensure precise calculations  
    3. Applying Prompt Engineering and Chain-of-Thought to improve reasoning response quality. 
    4. Design a single agent that can intelligently use these tools.
