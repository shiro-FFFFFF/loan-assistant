# Personal Loan Basics Guide

## What is a Personal Loan?

A personal loan is an unsecured loan that provides borrowers with a lump sum of money that can be used for various purposes such as debt consolidation, home improvements, medical expenses, or major purchases. Unlike secured loans, personal loans don't require collateral.

## Key Features of Personal Loans

### Fixed Interest Rates
Most personal loans come with fixed interest rates, meaning your monthly payment remains the same throughout the loan term.

### Loan Terms
Typical personal loan terms range from 12 to 84 months, depending on the lender and loan amount.

### Credit Requirements
Lenders typically require a good to excellent credit score (670 or higher) for the best rates and terms.

## Types of Personal Loans

1. **Debt Consolidation Loans** - Combine multiple debts into one payment
2. **Home Improvement Loans** - Fund renovations and repairs
3. **Medical Loans** - Cover unexpected medical expenses
4. **Auto Loans** - Purchase vehicles (though auto loans are often secured)
5. **Vacation Loans** - Fund travel and leisure expenses
