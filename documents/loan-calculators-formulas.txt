# Loan Calculators and Formulas

## Basic Loan Payment Formula

### Standard Amortization Formula
**M = P [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]**

Where:
- M = Monthly Payment
- P = Principal Loan Amount
- r = Monthly Interest Rate (annual rate ÷ 12)
- n = Total Number of Payments (loan term in months)

### Example Calculation
- **Loan Amount**: $25,000
- **Annual Interest Rate**: 8.5%
- **Loan Term**: 5 years (60 months)

**Step 1**: Calculate monthly interest rate
- r = 8.5% ÷ 12 = 0.085 ÷ 12 = 0.007083

**Step 2**: Calculate total payments
- n = 5 × 12 = 60

**Step 3**: Apply formula
- M = $25,000 [0.007083(1.007083)^60] / [(1.007083)^60 - 1]
- M = $25,000 [0.007083 × 1.517] / [1.517 - 1]
- M = $25,000 [0.01074] / [0.517]
- M = $25,000 × 0.02077
- **M = $519.25 per month**

## Interest-Only Payment Calculator

### Formula
**M = P × (r/12)**

### Example
- **Loan Amount**: $200,000
- **Annual Rate**: 6.0%
- **M = $200,000 × (0.06/12)**
- **M = $1,000 per month** (interest only)

## Total Interest Calculator

### Formula
**Total Interest = (M × n) - P**

### Example
- **Monthly Payment**: $519.25
- **Total Payments**: $519.25 × 60 = $31,155
- **Principal**: $25,000
- **Total Interest**: $31,155 - $25,000 = **$6,155**

## Loan Balance Calculator

### Formula (Remaining Balance)
**B = P × [(1+r)^n - (1+r)^k] / [(1+r)^n - 1]**

Where:
- B = Remaining Balance
- k = Number of Payments Made

### Example
After 24 payments on the $25,000 loan:
- **B = $25,000 × [(1.007083)^60 - (1.007083)^24] / [(1.007083)^60 - 1]**
- **B = $13,167.45**

## APR Calculator (Including Fees)

### Formula
**APR = ((1 + r/12)^12 - 1) × 100**

### With Fees Example
- **Loan Amount**: $20,000
- **Interest Rate**: 7.5%
- **Origination Fee**: $500 (2.5%)
- **Other Fees**: $200

**Effective Amount Received**: $19,300
**Monthly Payment**: $398.45
**APR Calculation**: Approximately 8.2%

## Debt-to-Income Ratio Calculator

### Formula
**DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income) × 100**

### Example
- **Monthly Income**: $6,000
- **Current Debt Payments**:
  - Mortgage/Rent: $1,500
  - Credit Cards: $300
  - Car Loan: $400
  - Student Loans: $250
- **Total Debt**: $2,450
- **DTI = ($2,450 / $6,000) × 100 = 40.8%**

## Loan Affordability Calculator

### Maximum Monthly Payment
**Max Monthly Payment = (Monthly Income × 0.28) - Other Debts**

### Maximum Loan Amount
**Max Loan = Max Monthly Payment × [((1+r)^n - 1) / (r(1+r)^n)]**

### Example
- **Monthly Income**: $6,000
- **Other Debts**: $800
- **Max Housing Payment**: ($6,000 × 0.28) - $800 = $880
- **Available for Mortgage**: $880

## Amortization Schedule Calculator

### Principal and Interest Allocation

**Payment 1**:
- **Interest**: $25,000 × 0.007083 = $177.08
- **Principal**: $519.25 - $177.08 = $342.17
- **Remaining Balance**: $25,000 - $342.17 = $24,657.83

**Payment 60**:
- **Interest**: $13,167.45 × 0.007083 = $93.30
- **Principal**: $519.25 - $93.30 = $425.95
- **Remaining Balance**: $0.00

## Compound Interest Calculator

### Formula (Future Value)
**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**

Where:
- A = Final Amount
- P = Principal
- r = Annual Interest Rate
- n = Compounding Frequency per Year
- t = Time in Years

### Example
- **Principal**: $10,000
- **Rate**: 6% annually
- **Compounding**: Monthly (12 times/year)
- **Time**: 5 years

**A = $10,000(1 + 0.06/12)^(12×5)**
**A = $10,000(1.005)^60**
**A = $13,488.50**

## Balloon Payment Calculator

### Formula
**B = P × (1+r)^k - M × [((1+r)^k - 1) / r]**

Where:
- B = Balloon Payment
- k = Number of Payments Until Balloon
- M = Regular Payment Amount

## Early Payoff Calculator

### Time Saved Formula
**Original Term - Remaining Payments = Time Saved**

### Interest Saved Formula
**Original Total Interest - Remaining Interest = Interest Saved**

### Example
- **Original Term**: 60 months
- **Payments Made**: 24 months
- **Time Saved**: 36 months
- **Interest Saved**: $3,247

## Loan Comparison Calculator

### Break-Even Analysis
**Break-Even Point = Additional Costs / Monthly Savings**

### Example
- **Refinance Costs**: $2,500
- **Monthly Savings**: $150
- **Break-Even Point**: $2,500 ÷ $150 = 16.7 months
