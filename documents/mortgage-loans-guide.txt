- n = Number of Payments (loan term × 12)

### Example Calculation
- **Loan Amount**: $300,000
- **Interest Rate**: 6.5% annually
- **Loan Term**: 30 years
- **Monthly Payment**: $1,896.20

### Total Interest Paid Example
- **Loan Amount**: $300,000
- **Total Payments**: $682,632
- **Total Interest**: $382,632
- **Interest Percentage**: 56.4% of total cost

## Mortgage Rates and Factors

- **Down Payment**: Larger down payment = lower rate
- **Loan Amount**: Conforming vs. jumbo loans
- **Property Type**: Primary, secondary, investment
- **Occupancy**: Owner-occupied vs. investment property
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Lower ratios = better rates

### Rate Types

2. **Check Credit Score**: Understand your credit standing
3. **Get Pre-Approved**: Know your budget before shopping
4. **Budget for Closing Costs**: 2-5% of purchase price
5. **Research Neighborhoods**: Consider schools, commute, amenities

### During the Process
1. **Don't Change Financial Situation**: Don't open new credit accounts
2. **Keep Documents Organized**: Maintain all paperwork
3. **Communicate with Lender**: Respond quickly to requests
4. **Get Home Inspection**: Protect yourself from hidden problems
5. **Review Closing Disclosure**: Compare to Loan Estimate

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Maxing Out Pre-Approval**: Borrowing the maximum amount
- **Skipping Home Inspection**: Saving money now, costing more later
- **Changing Jobs**: Stable employment preferred
- **Making Large Purchases**: New credit can affect debt-to-income ratio
- **Not Saving for Emergencies**: Keep funds for unexpected expenses

## Refinancing

### When to Refinance
- **Lower Interest Rates**: Rates dropped 1-2% from original
- **Improved Credit Score**: Better credit can qualify for better rates
- **Change Loan Term**: Shorten or extend loan term
- **Cash-Out**: Access home equity for other purposes
- **Remove PMI**: When home value increased

### Refinance Process
1. **Shop for Rates**: Compare multiple lenders
2. **Apply and Underwrite**: Similar to original mortgage process
3. **Appraisal**: May be required
4. **Closing**: Sign new loan documents
5. **Timeline**: 30-60 days typically

Remember: A mortgage is likely the largest debt you'll ever have. Take time to understand all terms, shop for the best rates, and ensure you can comfortably afford the monthly payments for the life of the loan.
